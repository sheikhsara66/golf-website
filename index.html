                    <p>We have all been on vacation with a significant other and found ourselves staring out the hotel window at a championship golf course with no plans to play. Bummer. But not with Foresome. While your loved one hits the spa, you can hit the links by matching yourself with compatible golf partners so that you can make the most out of your vacation. Find your ideal foursome or partner with a similar handicap, gambling companion, or drinking buddy using our proprietary algorithm.</p>

                        with ease</h3>
                    <p>Business trips can be a drag when none of your associates play golf and the conference is being held at a GOLF RESORT. But you never have to worry about that when you have Foresome. Instead of playing alone or risking getting paired with two slow pokes who can’t stop talking about their RV, you can use the app to find your ideal golf partners and make the most of your afternoon off. Stop wishing you had someone to play with and actually find someone to play with on Foresome.</p>

                   <p> Let those other apps worry about finding you a life partner. Foresome will find you the perfect golf partners for 4 hours of fun (or whatever your pace of play preferences are).</p>
